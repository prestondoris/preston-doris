        As a full stack software engineer I am driven to create beautiful, intuitive 
        and performant experiences. As a lifelong learner, I am committed to always 
        seeking a better way of doing things and challenging the status quo. Whether 
        building software, applications, or web experiences I believe in finding the 
        "why" behind the tool and letting that fuel a meaningful end result.
